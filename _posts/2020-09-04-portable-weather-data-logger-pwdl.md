Brief: _I designed and assembled a portable Arduino weather station to be used for on-the-go climate monitoring while recording field data._

This project was completed for my year 11 Personal Project (International Baccalaureate), and inspired by my uncle & aunt, a climate scientist & wildlife biologist, who perform dozens of measurements every hour on their research trips in the Peruvian Andes. My Weather Logger is designed to save them time while they focus on their field activities, being able to record the many different atmospheric conditions, log them in a human-readable document, map them (with GPS) perpetually, and with minimal input from the users.
Equipped with: GPS, barometer, altimeter, hygrometer, thermometer, UV sensor, external water temperature probe.  
Languages: `C++`
