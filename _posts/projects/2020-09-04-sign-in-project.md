_A 6-month project to develop a 'late-slip' printer and user interface, requiring only the students scan their ID card._

#### **â˜… Sign-in Project**

A 6-month project to develop a late-slip dispenser and software, created in response to students' frustration with the previous late arrivals sign-in system, which required them to wait on line to fill out a slip of paper, making them even later for class.  
With the new system, students scanned their ID card with a barcode scanner, would be registered as late on a database, and a receipt printer would print a late-slip for them to bring to their teacher.
Despite a complete working product, the school was unable to give access to the student database. The project ended up acting as a proof-of-concept, and subsequently a catalyst for the school to contract a company to install a fully-fledged sign-in system with sliding doors and RFID.
