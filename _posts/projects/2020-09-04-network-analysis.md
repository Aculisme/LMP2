#### **Network Analysis Version 14 (NV14)**

A project attempting to accurately visualize social structures within my year group. The only input is 'friendships' according to a poll conducted by 5 students in my year group. Nodes inputted into [Gephi](https://gephi.org), modelled with Yifan Hu Proportional model, and converted to website format with help from a Gephi plugin.  
Languages: `JavaScript` `Java` `SQL`  
Links: [NV14](https://nv14.netlify.app)

#### **â˜… Network Analysis Version 18 (NV18)**

A follow-up project of NV14, featuring updated friendships (accurate in Oct 2018) from a larger pool (100 students) and a more efficient edge generation methodology. Made with Gephi, modelled with Force Atlas 2, and available as downloadable images (currently).  
Languages: `PHP` `SQL` `Git`
