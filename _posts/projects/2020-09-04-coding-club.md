_Founded my school's first coding club._

#### **Coding Club**

Since my school doesn't offer formal coding classes, I decided to start the Coding Club with two friends of mine. I recruited roughly 12 students and taught them the fundamentals of website building, including JS, HTML, and CSS. I also acted as a mentor for students in younger grades working on coding projects for school.
