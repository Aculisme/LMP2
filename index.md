Hi I'm Luca, and I'm currently in my fourth year studying Computing at Imperial College London.

## Education

### Imperial College London (ICL) MEng Computing (4th Year) 2020-2024  

**Modules**: Distributed Algorithms, Scalable Systems and Data, Advanced Concurrency, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Deep Graph-Based Learning, Computer Vision, Network & Web Security

### Master’s Dissertation: SyncWave: Rapid and Adaptive Decentralized Time Synchronization for Swarm Robotic Systems (Supervisors: Dr. Michael Breza, Prof. Julie McCann)

*Abstract:*
Time synchronization in Robotic Swarm Systems can be an extremely powerful construct, allowing swarms to coordinate behavior and perform consensus on future actions within a bounded time, and is among the most essential areas of research within Swarm Systems. However, these systems have unique requirements that are not common in either of the fields of Distributed Systems, Wireless Sensor Networks, and Pulse-Coupled Oscillators – from which nearly all time synchronization protocols originate. Notably, robustness to arbitrary node and link failures, extremely short synchronization times, and robustness to a variety of challenging multi-hop, dense, and dynamic network topologies are all fundamental requirements that existing time synchronization protocols struggle with. In this report we propose SyncWave, a novel fully-decentralized time synchronization protocol that has beyond state-of-the-art millisecond-level convergence speeds, adaptive radio usage, and extreme robustness to challenging multi-hop, dense, and dynamic topologies. These findings have been experimentally shown through evaluation on a large-scale IoT testbed.
