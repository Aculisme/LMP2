  <summary> #### Glecksteinhütte SAC 2317m / Chrinnenhorn 2737m (24.6.20/25.6.20) </summary>
  A 2-day trip to Grindelwald's Glecksteinhütte, run by the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC). We took the Golden Pass train from Montreux to Interlaken West with Ahnaf Naoki and Anurag, then another split from the group and took a train from Interlaken Ost to Grindelwald. Finally, a bus took us to the trailhead at 1285m. We started walking at 15:00 (a full 6 hours since we set out), taking the T3 access trail around the base of the Byhorn and Chrinnenhorn, arriving at Glecksteinhütte at 18:30--exactly on time for dinner. We stayed there overnight, and set out the next day for the Chrinnenhorn summit--a considerably more challenging T4 trail. The path took us through several boulder fields and a snowdrift. We arrived at the 2737m summit at ~11:00, and enjoyed the view for just under an hour, before heading back down to Glecksteinhütte for Lunch. We then continued our way down, continuing past the bus stop and hiking all the way down to Grindelwald just in time for the 19:00 train. Completed with Ryoma.<br>
  Difficulty: T3 to the hut, T4 to the Chrinnenhorn summit.<br>
  Ascent: 1032m from Grindelwald trailhead to hut, 420m from hut to Chrinnenhorn summit. * 1452m total. * <br>
  Descent: 1737m descent from summit to Grindelwald trainstation.

  <summary> #### Rochers de Naye 2042m (7.7.20/8.7.20)</summary>
  A 24-hour trip up (and down) the Rochers de Naye above Montreux. This trip was quite spontaneous, with the location decided upon at 15:00 the day-of. All 4 of us held "7-to-5" passes (allowing us to train on most public trasport from 7pm to 5am), so we left Cornavin at 19:12, arrived at Montreux at 20:08, and only started hiking at 20:15. We hiked through sunset, then last light, complete darkness, and finally moonlight -- arriving at our campsite at 00:12 and sleeping slightly after 02:00. The next day, we packed up camp and made our way up to the summit for breakfast. Next, we hiked down the Chemin des Grottes (exploring several cool caves along the way), before climbing up the Dent de Jaman for a late lunch at 15:00. Our uphill done, we finally made our way back down to Montreux, taking a swim and catching the 19:17 train back to Cornavin -- almost exactly 24 hours after we started. Completed with Ryoma, Cathy, and Sébastien. <br>
  Difficulty: T3 <br>
  Ascent: 1416m from the Montreux train station (396m) to our campsite Sautodoz (1812m); 230m from Sautodoz to the Rochers de Naye summit, and later 173m up the Dent de Jaman (1875m). * 1819m total * <br>
  Descent: <br>
