<summary><h4 style="display: inline">Glecksteinhütte SAC 2317m / Chrinnenhorn 2737m (24.6.20/25.6.20)</h4></summary>
*A 2-day trip to Grindelwald's Glecksteinhütte, run by the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC).*  
We took the Golden Pass train from Montreux to Interlaken West with Ahnaf Naoki and Anurag, then another split from the group and took a train from Interlaken Ost to Grindelwald. Finally, a bus took us to the trailhead at 1285m. We started walking at 15:00 (a full 6 hours since we set out), taking the T3 access trail around the base of the Byhorn and Chrinnenhorn, arriving at Glecksteinhütte at 18:30--exactly on time for dinner. We stayed there overnight, and set out the next day for the Chrinnenhorn summit--a considerably more challenging T4 trail. The path took us through several boulder fields and a snowdrift. We arrived at the 2737m summit at ~11:00, and enjoyed the view for just under an hour, before heading back down to Glecksteinhütte for Lunch. We then continued our way down, continuing past the bus stop and hiking all the way down to Grindelwald just in time for the 19:00 train. Completed with Ryoma.
- **Difficulty**: **T3** to the hut, **T4** to the Chrinnenhorn summit.  
- **Ascent**: 1032m from Grindelwald trailhead to hut, 420m from hut to Chrinnenhorn summit. **1452m** total.    
- **Descent**: **-1737m** descent from summit to Grindelwald train station.

<summary><h4 style="display: inline">Rochers de Naye 2042m (7.7.20/8.7.20)</h4></summary>
*A 24-hour trip up (and down) the Rochers de Naye above Montreux.*  
This trip was quite spontaneous, with the location decided upon at 15:00 the day-of. All 4 of us held "7-to-5" passes (allowing us to train on most public trasport from 7pm to 5am), so we left Cornavin at 19:12, arrived at Montreux at 20:08, and only started hiking at 20:15. We hiked through sunset, then last light, complete darkness, and finally moonlight -- arriving at our campsite at 00:12 and sleeping slightly after 02:00. The next day, we packed up camp and made our way up to the summit for breakfast. Next, we hiked down the Chemin des Grottes (exploring several cool caves along the way), before climbing up the Dent de Jaman for a late lunch at 15:00. Our uphill done, we finally made our way back down to Montreux, taking a swim and catching the 19:17 train back to Cornavin -- almost exactly 24 hours after we started. Completed with Ryoma, Cathy, and Sébastien.
- **Difficulty:** **T3**   
- **Ascent:** 1416m from the Montreux train station (396m) to our campsite Sautodoz (1812m); 230m from Sautodoz to the Rochers de Naye summit, and later 173m up the Dent de Jaman (1875m). **1819m** total   
- **Descent:** **-1819m**

<summary><h4 style="display: inline">Cabane de Vélan SAC 2638m (9.7.20/10.7.20)</h4></summary>
*An easy overnight stay at the cabane de Vélan SAC in the far south of the Valais.*  
The trailhead was located in the small town of Bourg-St-Pierre (1632m), and we set off at ~14:45. The trail took us up a valley for about 2 hours, before ascending steeply up an arrete (+378m), at the top of which lay the hut. We stayed overnight and desceded the next day, narrowly escaping the rain at ~14:00. Completed with family.
- **Difficulty:** **T2**   
- **Ascent:** **1006m** from Bourg-St-Pierre (1632m) to the hut (2638m)  
- **Descent:** **-1006m**

<summary><h4 style="display: inline">Schönebielhütte SAC 2694m (11.7.20-13.7.20) / Schönebielhorn 3261m</h4></summary>
*A 3-day/2-night stay in the Schönebielhütte SAC hut, with a trip up the Schönebielhorn.*  
The walk to the hut was quite long, but not technically difficult. We started from a hotel in Zermatt (1588m) at ~11:30, hiking up through Zmutt and Chalbermatta and following the Zmuttbachm river up the valley. We finally arrived at the hut at 16:31: 5 hours, 14km horizontally, and 1106m vertically from where we started. The next day we took a little-used trail headed toward the top of the Schönebielhorn, a 3471m mountain on which the hut was located. the path started very steep (30°+) and then ascended a large and very steep snow field (without crampons or ice picks!) located inside one of the mountain's corries. The path was not officially listed, and tampered off for 150m+ stretches. At the top of the snowfield, a very steep scree-covered path lead to the highest hikable arête, which I scrambled up alone and without a bag. The remaining 210m to the summit would have been without any path at all, and straight up the rock. Hut hike completed with family and summit attempt completed with Kenji and Garrett.
- **Difficulty:** **T2** to hut, **T4+** to highest hikable arête   
- **Ascent:** 1106m from Zermatt (1588m) to the hut (2694m), 567m from the hut to the highest hikable arête (3261m). **1673** total.  
- **Descent:** **-1673**
