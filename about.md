#### **Numerical Methods Maths Paper**

For my Maths Internal Assessment I wrote a paper exploring various numerical numerical methods and their applications in zero-finding and root-solving. I compared the Bisection method, Newton's method, and Secant method in terms of their rate & order of convergence and potential breakpoints. I also implemented the algorithms in Python and wrote a set of benchmarking scripts compare how long each took to converge on a known root.

#### **Network Analysis Version 14 (NV14)**

A project attempting to accurately visualize social structures within my year group. The only input is 'friendships' according to a poll conducted by 5 students in my year group. Nodes inputted into [Gephi](https://gephi.org), modelled with Yifan Hu Proportional model, and converted to website format with help from a Gephi plugin.  
Languages: `JavaScript` `Java` `SQL`  
Status: `completed`

#### **Network Analysis Version 18 (NV18)**

A follow-up project of NV14, featuring updated friendships (accurate in Oct 2018) from a larger pool (100 students) and a more efficient edge generation methodology. Made with Gephi, modelled with Force Atlas 2, and available as downloadable images (currently).

#### **Sign-in Project**

A 6-month project to develop a late-slip dispenser and software, created in response to students' frustration with the previous late arrivals sign-in system, which required them to wait on line to fill out a slip of paper, making them even later for class.  
With the new system, students scanned their ID card with a barcode scanner, would be registered as late on a database, and a receipt printer would print a late-slip for them to bring to their teacher.
Despite a complete working product, the school was unable to give access to the student database. The project ended up acting as a proof-of-concept, and subsequently a catalyst for the school to contract a company to install a fully-fledged sign-in system with sliding doors and RFID.

#### **Portable Weather Data Logger (PWDL)**

This project was completed for my Personal Project (International Baccalaureate), and inspired by my uncle & aunt, a climate scientist & wildlife biologist, who perform dozens of measurements every hour on their research trips in the Peruvian Andes. My Weather Logger is designed to save them time while they focus on their field activities, being able to record the many different atmospheric conditions, log them in a human-readable document, map them (with GPS) perpetually, and with minimal input from the users.
Equipped with: GPS, barometer, altimeter, hygrometer, thermometer, UV sensor, external water temperature probe.  
Languages: `C++`

#### **Coding Club**

Since my school doesn't offer formal coding classes, I decided to start the Coding Club with two friends of mine. I recruited roughly 12 students and taught them the fundamentals of website building, including JS, HTML, and CSS. I also acted as a mentor for students in younger grades working on coding projects for school. 

#### **MEAI (MemeEconomy Artificial Intelligence)**

#### **ASCII converter bot**

Originally a simple programming exercise, this project is now so large that it is best described as two separate parts:

1. An efficient and novel media converter from any video format into a gif/video created from only ASCII characters.
2. A Reddit bot created using PRAW which can be 'summoned' to convert a video submission into its ASCII equivalent. [still in progress]  
Languages: `Python`  
Version control: `Git` | `BitBucket` | (Private)  

#### **Custom event ticketing software**

Every year my school meets with the other two campuses to participate in (and organize) the Bal des Neiges, a winter ball. Every year it attracts 400+ students to each of the two nights (Juniors and Seniors). As part of the Student Council, I was among those responsible for organizing this event. And as the most tech-savvy among our campus's student council (to the best of my knowledge), I was tasked with developing a solution to ticketing at the door.  
I designed tickets to be used across all three campuses and had them printed at a local print-shop. Then, I worked with a younger student from Coding Club to quickly develop a website that could be used to verify that the tickets were valid, mark them as activated, and check whether they had already been used. This system worked so well, with an average of 2 seconds or less to check in each ticket (compared to 20 seconds previously), that it will be used across all three campuses in future years.
