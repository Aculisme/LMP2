#### **MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute**

I was selected to participate in a month-long summer program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, US. I had to complete 3 online courses in Python, Github, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), before applying to my chosen course: Unmanned Air System Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAS-SAR).  
I worked in a team of 4 to process data from a radar module mounted on a drone, generating an image of an unseen target area. After working collaboratively on custom Python algorithms in our teams for the last 2 weeks, my team won first place in the final competition.
